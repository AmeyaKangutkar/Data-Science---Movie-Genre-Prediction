# Data-Science---Movie-Genre-Prediction
•	Generated machine learning classifier models to predict movie genre based on the plot summary of 20000 set of movies.
•	Cleaned, pre-processed, using Stemming, Lemmitizing, removing stopwords-special characters, and using word cloud generator to focus on most used words for a genre. 
•	Converted text data into numerical using Count Vectorizer and Vector transform.
•	Predicted movie category using most accurate models among logistic regression, linear-svc, k-neighbors classifier, random forest classifier and decision tree classifier.
